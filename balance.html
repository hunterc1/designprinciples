     <h1>Balance</h1>
     <p>In design, we think of balance in terms of visual weight. You want your
designs and layouts to be visually balanced, unless your communication
purpose is to unsettle people by making them feel unbalanced and tense
or anxious. There are three kinds of visual balance: radial, symmetrical
and asymmetrical.(p.51)</p>
     <h2>How Can We Interpret Balance?</h2>
       <p>Balance is how well your communication is spaced out. We can imagine seeing a page with all the content on the right side, and nothing on the left, ugly right?</p>
       
           <figure>
     <img src="Balance.jpg" class="responsive" alt="Balance"/>
     <figcaption>This design is well balanced, even though it has a lot of words and pictures, everything is evenly spaced apart.
     </figcaption>
   </figure>
    <br>
       
       <p>Balance is important because nobody wants to see something that just does not look right. Imagine getting on a web page, and there is only content on the bottom right. You would not want to work on this web page.</p>
