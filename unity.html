     <h1>Unity</h1>
     <p>According to the book, Unity means that all the parts of the design work together,
and everything looks like it belongs together. (p. 55)</p>
      <h2>How Can We Interpret Unity?</h2>
       <p>Unity is the overall feel we get when we step back and look at something. Everything needs to make sense in order for work. If nothing is lined up and everything is different sizes, nothing will look unified. Unity can help us give the best overall look possible, while still making everything make sense.</p>

     <figcaption>This design shows unity because everything is spaced the same way, and the same font is used over and over.

       <p>Imagine this, you are a web developer for a landscaping company. You are tasked to design a website. On your website, you have a blog article about trucks, thats beside a picture of a lama, and then an add for Dove womens soap. You could not expect much traffic to your website if it was not unified. Unity is important to design because without it, our viewers would get lost and not know where to go, or what to do. </p>
