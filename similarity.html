     <h1>Similarity</h1>
     <p>According to the book, Our minds group things with similar
properties, such as color or shape. (p. 76)</p>
     <h2>How Can We Interpret Similarity?</h2>
       <p>Similarity can be thought as things that go together. When we make something similar, we will naturally group the things that are similar together. It can help us quickly group things without having to directly tell our audience that they need to be grouped. </p>

     <figcaption>The font used, and the pictures that are drawn all have the same look to this, this is similarity.

       <p>We use similarity a lot more than we think in everyday life. Have you ever seen a poster with several big red marks on it, that says do not do this? This indicated to us to group everything with big red marks together, so we know not to do them. Using similarity in your content can be a quick and easy way to allow your audience to follow along and group things together, without you having to spell out and explain every little detail.</p>
