     <h1>Closure</h1>
     <p>According to the book, closure is when " We mentally fill in the gaps
in order to complete a perceived
shape." (p.78)</p>
     <h2>How Can We Interpret Closure?</h2>
       <p>The best way to think about closure, is to think about cutting out things. If you take a piece of paper, and cut out a snowman shape in the middle of it, then it just becomes a cut out piece of paper. However, because we mentally fill these gaps, everyone will look at the paper and see a snowman, even though we have not drawn a snowman, we have simply filled in the gaps mentally.</p>

     <figcaption>This design cuts out a bug, on top of a rat. Thanks to closure our minds will mentally let us see that there are multiple bugs inside the rat.

       <p>In real design, closure is a great way to use white space to your advantage. White space is not the enemy and with closure you can strategically use it to make your design better. If you cut out the brand name out of a picture, your mind will read the brand name even though there is nothing there, this is an example of a positive use of white space. </p>
