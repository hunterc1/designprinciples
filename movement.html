     <h1>Movement</h1>
     <p>According to the book, The principle of movement goes back to the idea that good design
controls the eyeâ€™s flow through the composition. The flow of lines can
move the eye across the page or screen.</p>
      <h2>How Can We Interpret Movement?</h2>
       <p>Movement can be seen in several different ways. When we think about the angle a car is at, that is movement. When we see a blur, that symbolizes movement. Lines can direct us where to look, by movement.</p>

     <figcaption>This sign is indicating a direction to go, which implies movement.

       <p>Movement is important because if you want to convey that something has motion, you need to use this principle of design to do so. If you need to direct your audience in a certain way, you can use the principle of movement to do so, like lines and arrows. </p>
