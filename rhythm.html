     <h1>Rhythm</h1>
     <p>According to the book, A pattern, whether regular or irregular, also may create a sort of
movement we could call rhythm. (p. 53)</p>
      <h2>How Can We Interpret Rhythm?</h2>
       <p>We can think about rhythm as a repeating certain objects over and over. Rhythm can give your content a flow that allows people to easily jump from one thing to the next.</p>

     <figcaption>This design represents rhythm because the lines are evenly repeating across the paper.

       <p>Rhythm is an important principle of design because pattern and flow can help to give the viewers a sense of togetherness, as well as lead them from one thing to the next. Imagine if none of the shapes lined up, the fonts were all different sizes and types, there were 15 different colors, and lines were uneven no body would want to look at your work.</p>
