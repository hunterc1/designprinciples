     <h1>Continuity</h1>
     <p>According to the book Continuity can be explained as, Our minds will continue a pattern beyond its ending points.
Further, our eyes will follow the direction of a line. (p. 76) </p>
      <h2>How Can We Interpret Continuity?</h2>
       <p>Continuity can be thought of as continuing on the same path. Take the interstate for example, sometimes to stay on the same interstate you have to slightly merge, but you continue on the same interstate. Continuity is just that, it takes what our eyes our looking at, and directs us to the next path just like a road.</p>

     <figcaption>The dotted line in this design directs your eyes down the picture to help direct you from one paragraph to the next, this is continuity.

   </figure>
    <br>
       <p>Continuity can be important in design because sometimes we want our audience to look at thins in a certain order, or way. The best way to do this is to use Continuity to lead our audiences eyes from the aspect we want them to see first, to the aspect we want them to see second.</p>
