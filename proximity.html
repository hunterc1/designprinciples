     <h1>Proximity</h1>
     <p>According to the book, proximity is a way "We
perceive objects
that are close
together as
belonging to the
same group." (p. 76)</p>
      <h2>How Can We Interpret Proximity?</h2>
       <p>The simplest way to think about proximity is to think about what is close together. When we see things clumped up, or moving in the same direction, we assume that they go together. Proximity can be a great way for us to group things that we want to be seen together. </p>

     <figcaption>This design represents proximity because certain things are grouped together such as "activities" and "info"

       <p>Imagine a website that has A random picture, then the link to another website, then a blog post, and then a store all right next to each other. You would be very confused and not sure how to navigate or get anywhere. Proximity can be a great way to help us group up and cluster things that we want our viewers to see at the same time.</p>
